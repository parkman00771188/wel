/**
 * Cursor -> event lookup.
 *
 * A THREE.Raycaster against 60k Points would rebuild the bounding volume and
 * test every vertex with a world-space threshold; instead we sweep the visible
 * draw range once and keep the vertex whose *angular* offset from the ray is
 * smallest, which matches how big the dot looks on screen at any zoom.
 *
 * This relies on the world group carrying only a Y scale (no rotation or
 * translation), so a vertex's world position is just (x, y * exaggeration, z).
